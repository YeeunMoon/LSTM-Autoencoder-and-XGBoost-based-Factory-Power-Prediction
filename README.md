# LSTM-Autoencoder-and-XGBoost-based-Factory-Power-Prediction
This study aims to predict the medium-term power consumption of industrial facilities, especially forging processes, and detect anomalies in energy consumption to improve the operational efficiency of the power system and minimize the environmental impact.

To accurately predict power usage, we propose an ensemble model combining extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE). The dataset includes power consumption data from a forging process in a manufacturing plant, as well as system load and system marginal price data.
